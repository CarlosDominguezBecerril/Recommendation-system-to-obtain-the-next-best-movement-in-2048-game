# Recommendation system to obtain the next best movement in 2048 game

## Project description

2048 is often played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of 2. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. The intend of this project is to build a neural network using neuroevolution to add a component that improves the game experience, in our case, we implement a recommendation system to obtain the next best movement that can be done in the game to make the experience for the user easier.
